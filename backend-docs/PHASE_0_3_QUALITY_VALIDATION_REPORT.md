Scores (70-95/100) appropriately reflect:
- Primary segments: 90-95/100 (best fit)
- Secondary segments: 80-90/100 (good fit)
- Tertiary segments: 70-80/100 (potential fit)

### 3. Red Flags Relevance
Each company's red flags accurately identify poor-fit customers:
- Industry-specific concerns (regulated industries, compliance)
- Technical constraints (on-prem requirements, legacy systems)
- Budget misalignment (price sensitivity, limited budgets)
