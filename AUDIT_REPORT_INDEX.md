## CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Production)

### Issue #1: Test Coverage (26.95% vs 80% required)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Impact:** Cannot deploy to production
- **Files:** Multiple controllers and services
- **Effort:** 40-52 hours

### Issue #2: Untested Controllers (0% coverage)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Files:** companyResearchController.js (752 lines), icpFrameworkController.js (815 lines)
- **Effort:** 20-30 hours per controller

### Issue #3: Test Failures (16 failing)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **File:** tests/supabaseDataService.test.js
- **Root Cause:** Mock configuration issues
- **Effort:** 8-12 hours

### Issue #4: Test Environment Security Bypass
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **File:** src/middleware/supabaseAuth.js (lines 13-56)
- **Risk:** Accepts ANY Bearer token in test/dev
- **Effort:** 4 hours

### Issue #5: Memory-Based Rate Limiting
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **File:** src/middleware/auth.js (lines 254-304)
- **Problem:** Doesn't persist across restarts, doesn't scale
- **Effort:** 12 hours (Redis implementation)
